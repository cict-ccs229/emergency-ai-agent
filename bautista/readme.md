## How It Works

1. When a user requests emergency assistance, the agent asks for confirmation before proceeding.
2. If confirmed, it retrieves the userâ€™s approximate location via IP geolocation.
3. The agent lists nearby hospitals in Iloilo City.
4. It attempts to contact hospitals to dispatch an ambulance and informs the user about ambulance status and ETA.
5. If ambulances are unavailable or location is unknown, it responds accordingly.
6. The agent also handles queries about nearby hospitals without dispatching ambulances.
7. Non-emergency queries are politely declined.
